Here's the complete code — the file is already available for download above! It's a single self-contained `.jsx` file with everything included.

But if you'd like it split into a downloadable **project structure** (with `package.json`, `index.html`, `tailwind.config.js`, etc.) so you can run it locally, I can generate that too. Just let me know!

In the meantime, here's a quick reminder of what's in the file:

**To run it locally:**
1. Create a new Vite + React project: `npm create vite@latest my-dashboard -- --template react`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install lucide-react`
3. Add Tailwind CSS: follow [tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite)
4. Replace the contents of `src/App.jsx` with the downloaded file
5. Run: `npm run dev`

Want me to generate the full ready-to-run project with all config files?
